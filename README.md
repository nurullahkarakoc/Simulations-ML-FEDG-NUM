Code for the numerical results in a lot papers we published on ML/FEDG-NUM techniques

Authored by Nurullah Karakoc. 

Main code for the results in papers "Multi-layer decomposition of optimal resource sharing problems" and
"Multi-layer decomposition of network utility maximization problems" is 'Sim.m'.

Main code for the results in papers "Federated network utility maximization" and 
"Federated Edge Network Utility Maximization for a Multi-Server System: Algorithm and Convergence" is in 
'FEDNUM_NEWSIM_CLEAN.m'.
